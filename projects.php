  <h2>AMAZON FULFILLMENT AND SORTATION CENTER</h2>
  <strong>KENOSHA, WI -</strong> The Amazon Fulfillment and Sortation Centers are 1 million square foot and 500 thousand square foot buildings located along I-94 at Burlington Road. Chaput Land Surveys prepared an ALTA/NSPS Land Title Survey for the due diligence  phase of the site development. Chaput also prepared a Topographic Survey for the civil engineers to create the construction plans for the project. The ALTA/NSPS survey shows the property boundaries, easements and other encumberances on the property such as access to the property, utilities that service the property, zoning information, FEMA floodplain information, etc. Chaput also prepared 2 Certified Survey Maps (CSM) to redivide 7 parcels into 2 parcels for the project. The land development process also is used to create easements for the utilities and stormwater management areas. Chaput also prepared control exhibits to help contractors using GPS machine control for grading. Our construction services were used for grading ponds, setting building corners and columns, installing sanitary sewer, watermain and fire protection, storm sewer systems, light poles, pumphouses, floodplain protection, curb, signs, and retaining walls. Chaput also prepared as-built record drawings for the ponds, anchor bolt elevations and conveyor system. Once the project was completed Chaput prepared ALTA/NSPS Land Title Survey of the property and finished features of the project for refinancing after construction. The project was challenging, however, having good in house data management and communication with contractors it was a successful project.<br>

  <h2>MEQUON TOWN CENTER</h2>
  <strong>MEQUON, WI -</strong> Mequon Town Center at the intersection of Mequon Road and Cedarburg Road is a multi purpose development of apartments, shops and restaurants. Chaput Land Surveys was contracted for construction services for this project. This project had the challenge of a tight work site with many different construction trades working on different aspects of this project. Our staff laid out the buildings for the contractor, along with the building corners, columns were staked as well as the elevator shaft. Next we laid out the sanitary sewer, watermain and storm sewer systems and finally the curb, parking lot and sidewalk.<br>
