  <h2>AMAZON FULFILLMENT AND SORTATION CENTER</h2>
  <strong>KENOSHA, WI -</strong> The Amazon Fulfillment and Sortation Centers are 1 million square foot and 500 thousand square foot buildings located along I-94 at Burlington Road. Chaput Land Surveys prepared an ALTA/NSPS Land Title Survey for the due diligence  phase of the site development. Chaput also prepared a Topographic Survey basemap used to develop the construction plans for the project. The ALTA/NSPS survey shows the property boundaries, easements and other encumberances on the property such as access to the property, utilities that service the property, zoning information, FEMA floodplain information, etc. Chaput also prepared 2 Certified Survey Maps (CSM) to redivide 7 parcels into 2 parcels for the project. The land development process also is used to create easements for the utilities and stormwater management areas. Chaput also prepared control exhibits to assist contractors using GPS machine control for grading. Our construction services were used for grading ponds, setting building corners and columns, installing sanitary sewer, watermain and fire protection, storm sewer systems, light poles, pumphouses, floodplain protection, curb, signs, and retaining walls. Chaput also prepared as-built record drawings for the ponds, anchor bolt elevations and conveyor system. Once the project was completed Chaput prepared ALTA/NSPS Land Title Survey of the property and finished features of the project for refinancing after construction. The challenging project required good in house data management and communication with contractors making it a successful project completed on time.<br>

  <strong>MEQUON, WI -</strong> Mequon Town Center at the intersection of Mequon Road and Cedarburg Road is a multi-purpose development of apartments, shops and restaurants.
